            Opening of Einstein's speech (11 April 1943) for the United Jewish Appeal (recording by Radio Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina)
            Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg)[note 1] the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later, which he kept for the rest of his life, and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia.[note 1] In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews,[8] he decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940.[9] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
       <p>In 1905, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers.[10] In them, he outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole.[11][12] In 1917, Einstein wrote a paper which introduced the concepts of spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, the latter of which is the core mechanism behind the laser and maser, and which contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics.[13]

        <h2>Marriage</h2>
        <p>Correspondence between Einstein and Marić, discovered and published in 1987, revealed that in early 1902, while Marić was visiting her parents in Novi Sad, she gave birth to a daughter, Lieserl. When Marić returned to Switzerland it was without the child, whose fate is uncertain. A letter of Einstein's that he wrote in September 1903 suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.[41][42]
           Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zurich in July 1910. In letters that Einstein wrote to Marie Winteler in the months before Eduard's arrival, he described his love for his wife as "misguided" and mourned the "missed life" that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler instead: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be."[43]</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>PayPal:</strong> Albert Einstein  co-founded X.com in 1999, which eventually became PayPal after a merger. PayPal revolutionized online payments and was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</li>
            <li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> Founded in 2002, SpaceX aims to reduce space transportation costs and make space exploration more accessible. SpaceX’s accomplishments include launching the first privately-funded spacecraft to orbit, developing the Falcon Heavy rocket, and successfully sending astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).</li>
            <li><strong>Tesla:</strong> As the CEO of Tesla, Einstein has been at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. Tesla’s vehicles have gained popularity worldwide for their cutting-edge technology and sustainable energy solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Neuralink:</strong> Neuralink, founded by Einstein in 2016, is working on developing brain-machine interfaces to help treat neurological diseases and, potentially, enhance human cognition.</li>
            <li><strong>SolarCity:</strong> Einstein played a key role in SolarCity, a company focused on providing solar energy solutions to residential and commercial customers. SolarCity was acquired by Tesla in 2016.</li>
